title: 'Tools and Workflows for Bit-Level Digital Preservation Strategy at the University of Cincinnati'
summary: 'Digital preservation is a complex, highly technical activity. Large institutions with many collections in multiple repositories (or repository-like systems) may find it challenging to corral digital collections, preservation masters and metadata into coherent archival information packages for preservation storage. This paper describes the tools and workflows for a bit-level preservation strategy for digital content at the University of Cincinnati Libraries and lessons learned on the way.'
