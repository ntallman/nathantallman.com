title: Seeking Sustainability
subtitle: 'Developing a Modern Distributed Digital Preservation System'
summary: 'As modern commercial developments in storage infrastructure mature and become increasingly available through popular open-source projects, there are important opportunities for digital preservation communities to leverage the increased efficiency and flexibility that these technologies offer. Not only do these developments offer a way to “modernize” the digital preservation technology stack and make it more efficient, but they also may allow digital preservation communities to seek increased sustainability per the triple bottom line: reduce the costs of operations, reduce required labor to maintain, and reduce the environmental impact. The twin values of affordability and sustainability are core to the mission of digital preservation, and the MetaArchive Cooperative is pursuing the research and development of a modern distributed digital preservation system to better practice these values.'

abstract: 'As modern commercial developments in
storage infrastructure mature and become
increasingly available through popular open-source
projects, there are important opportunities for digital
preservation communities to leverage the increased
efficiency and flexibility that these technologies offer.
Not only do these developments offer a way to
“modernize” the digital preservation technology stack
and make it more efficient, but they also may allow
digital preservation communities to seek increased
sustainability per the triple bottom line: reduce the
costs of operations, reduce required labor to maintain,
and reduce the environmental impact. The twin values
of affordability and sustainability are core to the
mission of digital preservation, and the MetaArchive
Cooperative is pursuing the research and development
of a modern distributed digital preservation system to
better practice these values.
Since its inception in 2004, MetaArchive has used
Stanford University’s Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe
(LOCKSS) software for its core infrastructure to
achieve distributed digital preservation. While LOCKSS
has been reliable software for many years, recent
evaluations by MetaArchive and a desire to make its
practices more sustainable have led to MetaArchive
partnering with Keeper Technology to explore
software-defined storage and serverless computing
technologies for digital preservation. The results of
this multi-phase project will be shared with the digital
preservation community, with the hopes that it will
encourage other digital preservation technological
developments with a similar sustainability mindset.'
