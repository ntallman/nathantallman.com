title: "Appraisal and Selection for Digital Preservation"
event: ALA Ohio, Special Collections and Archives Interest Group Webinars
abstract: "Selection for digital preservation should be a collaborative endeavor between preservation practitioners and collection stewards. Digital preservation practitioners can work collaboratively with collection stewards to make these decisions by providing a framework and criteria for appraising digital content that incorporates representation and agency. Rooted in traditional collection development criteria for both general and special collections, Tallman and Lauren Work (University of Virginia) have previously published [Guidelines and Criteria to Select for Digital Preservation](https://osf.io/8y6dc/). This talk will review their framework, implementation of selection for digital preservation at Penn State (including local guidelines), a weighted rubric for evaluating criteria, and an easy-to-use selection form."
