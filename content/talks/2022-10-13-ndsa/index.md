summary:
abstract: Fixity is often practiced as a one-size fits all approach for demonstrating the integrity of data, with preferences for using strong cryptographic algorithms. This may accomplish the task, but at a cost. Algorithms for data integrity can be optimized for specific purposes to decrease environmental impacts and increase system efficiency.
