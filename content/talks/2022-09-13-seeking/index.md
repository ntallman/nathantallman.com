title: "Seeking Sustainability: Developing a Modern Distributed Digital Preservation System."
event: iPRES 2022
address:
  city: Glasgow
  region: Scotland
  country: United Kingdom
summary:
abstract: "As modern commercial developments in storage infrastructure mature and become increasingly available through popular open-source projects, there are important opportunities for digital preservation communities to leverage the increased efficiency and flexibility that these technologies offer. Not only do these developments offer a way to “modernize” the digital preservation technology stack and make it more efficient, but they also may allow digital preservation communities to seek increased sustainability per the triple bottom line: reduce the costs of operations, reduce required labor to maintain, and reduce the environmental impact. The twin values of affordability and sustainability are core to the mission of digital preservation, and the MetaArchive Cooperative is pursuing the research and development of a modern distributed digital preservation system to better practice these values."
