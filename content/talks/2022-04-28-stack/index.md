title: "Sustaining the Stack: Modernizing Digital Preservation Infrastructure For Increased Sustainability"
event: OPF Webinars
abstract: "Cultural heritage organizations (CHO) commonly use technical approaches that are rooted in the 1990s and early 2000s. This was a time when it was mostly just CHOs and governments who were concerned with data integrity and had to solve these challenges themselves. Since then, data integrity has become mission critical in the commercial sector where innovative solutions emerged. CHOs will benefit from adopting some of these approaches by leveraging advancements in infrastructure and simplifying business logic to increase overall economic, labor, and environmental sustainability."
