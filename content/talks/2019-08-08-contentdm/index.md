abstract: "PowerShell is a command line language pre-installed on Windows computers. It can be used to streamline digital collection building in CONTENTdm, including generating load packages for compound objects and making batch metadata edits, including multiple changes on each record, with ease. If you are frustrated with the limitations of Project Client, gives these scripts a try. While PowerShell is a command line tool, the scripts are fairly straight forward and user friendly."
