My philosophy on digital preservation is two-fold. First, **good stewardship is fiduciarily responsible**, regardless of an organization's resources. Without sustainable strategies, resources required for digital preservation can easily escalate and eventually put the organization’s mission at risk. Second, **a successful digital preservation program is an embedded culture**. Digital preservation requires all stakeholders to have the shared understanding that nearly every aspect of the creation and management of digital content has preservation implications. As a collaborative leader, I engage stakeholders to develop this understanding.

I am currently the Digital Preservation Librarian at the [Penn State University Libraries](https://libraries.psu.edu). I coordinate policies, workflows and practices to ensure the long-term preservation and accessibility of the Libraries’ born-digital and digitized collections. I advise on equipment, infrastructure, and vendors for Penn State digital content.
