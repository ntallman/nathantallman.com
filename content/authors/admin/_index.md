My philosophy on digital preservation is two-fold. First, **good stewardship is fiduciarily responsible**, regardless of an organization's resources. Without sustainable strategies, resources required for digital preservation can easily escalate and eventually put the organization’s mission at risk. Second, **a successful digital preservation program is an embedded culture**. Digital preservation requires all stakeholders to have the shared understanding that nearly every aspect of the creation and management of digital content has preservation implications. As a collaborative leader, I engage stakeholders to develop this understanding.

I am the Executive Director of [Academic Preservation Trust](https://aptrust.org). I articulate a vision and execute strategic management for a community-owned distributed digital preservation service. I provide operational oversight of APTrust operations, including the development of plans and processes for the lifecycle of deposited content and the integration of digital preservation processes at existing and prospective APTrust member institutions.
