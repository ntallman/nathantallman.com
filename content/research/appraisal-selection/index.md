Selection for digital preservation is a common stumbling block among cultural heritage organizations, who sometimes select nothing or everything out of analysis paralysis. The best way to control long-term digital preservation costs is to control the amount of content being preserved. "Cheap storage" does not equate to digitally preserve everything; digital preservation consumes many resources.

With my collaborator Lauren Work, we provided an [evidenced-based, pragmatic framework for digital preservation selection](/publications/tallman-2018-approaching/). Our framework centers the decision-making on subject matter experts, while also considering preservation-specific criteria. This framework is the foundation for the [Penn State Guidelines to Select Levels of Digital Preservation Commitment](/uploads/pennStateGuidelinesToSelectLevels.pdf). Following publication of our 2018 paper (Approaching Appraisal), we have continued to develop the framework, incorporating additional voices and perspectives. We hope to publish a follow-up in 2024.
